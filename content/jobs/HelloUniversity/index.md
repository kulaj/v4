- Conceptualized and established an academic mentorship service targeted towards international students interested in
studying abroad in the United States.
- Engaged with international clients during a week abroad in Shanghai and Beijing while developing effective communication
strategies across cultural boundaries. These meetings also provided insights into the challenges of establishing and
maintaining a company in a foreign market space. This undertaking enabled our team to develop a payment-processing
strategy in compliance with the Chinese government before it became an impedance to our business model.
- Streamlined the recruitment process for a network of US-based mentors attending top universities including Harvard,
Stanford, and Yale to provide consultation sessions to our clients. To date, over 50 mentors have signed with us as session
proctors.
